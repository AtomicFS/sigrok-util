This is a small script for compiling sigrok and its dependencies
on Mac OS X.


Status
------

Working.


Requirements
------------

 - All requirements of the individual sigrok subprojects.
 - Homebrew (http://brew.sh)
   Currently the script assumes that Homebrew is used and hardcodes certain
   package versions and paths.


Building
--------

 $ ./sigrok-native-macosx

Per default it will install the compiled packages in:

 $HOME/sr_macosx

Please edit the script if you want to change any settings.
