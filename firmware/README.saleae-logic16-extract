The saleae-logic16-extract.py tool extracts FPGA bitstreams from the
vendor software for the Saleae Logic16 USB logic analyzer. Download
the Linux version (either 32-bit or 64-bit will do), and unpack it
to find the main binary called "Logic".

Usage:

$ ./saleae-logic16-extract.py Logic
saved 149516 bytes to saleae-logic16-fpga-18.bitstream
saved 149516 bytes to saleae-logic16-fpga-33.bitstream

Copy the resulting files over to the location where sigrok installed its
firmware files. By default this is /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware.
